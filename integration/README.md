# Integration tests

Integration tests run the Observe CLI as a subprocess against a real tenant.

## Running locally

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the `OBSERVE_INTEGRATION_*` variables. Integration tests load `.env` automatically — no need to export variables in your shell.

```bash
bun run test:integration
```

| Variable                        | Required | Description                           |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `OBSERVE_INTEGRATION_CUSTOMER`  | yes      | Observe customer ID                   |
| `OBSERVE_INTEGRATION_DOMAIN`    | yes      | Tenant domain (e.g. `observeinc.com`) |
| `OBSERVE_INTEGRATION_API_TOKEN` | yes      | API token for the customer            |

The CLI reaches the API at `https://{customerId}.{domain}`. Include a port in the domain when your tenant uses a non-standard HTTPS port (e.g. `observeinc.com:8443`).

Tests fail at startup when required variables are missing.

## Writing tests

Integration tests must run against **any** tenant with valid credentials.

Some operations are safe on every functional tenant without creating resources:

- **Datasets** — every tenant has at least a System dataset, so tests may list datasets or query one.
- **Auth status** — validates credentials from env, not tenant inventory.

For other resource types (monitors, alerts, ingest tokens, etc.), either **create the resource in the test** or use **`testCiOnly`** when CI has known fixtures. Do not assume arbitrary tenant inventory exists.

`testCiOnly` (from `fixture.ts`) runs only when `CI=true` and is skipped locally:

```typescript
testCiOnly("view pre-configured monitor", async () => {
  // depends on OBSERVE_INTEGRATION_MONITOR_ID or similar CI env
});
```

File names like `smoke.test.ts` are for human organization only.

## CI-only tests

Some commands only work against the CI integration tenant (e.g. tag search permissions). Mark these with `testCiOnly` from `fixture.ts` — they run when `CI=true` and are skipped locally.

The CI integration tenant is expected to have:

- **Kubernetes Explorer** and **Tracing Explorer** content packs installed (required by `content.test.ts`)
- **Host Explorer** not installed — `content host view` returns `null` (also asserted in `content.test.ts`)

You do not need to install content before CI runs unless those packs are removed from the tenant.

The fixture sets `OBSERVE_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL=1` automatically so experimental commands (ingest-token, content, data-connection, etc.) are enabled in every integration test.

## Known gaps

| Commands                                     | Reason                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `auth login`, `auth logout`                  | Interactive / browser flows              |
| `cli install`, `uninstall`, `upgrade`        | Mutates local machine                    |
| `content * install`                          | Creates tenant content packs             |
| `datasource create/update`                   | Requires data connection + datastream    |
| `data-connection view`, `generate-stack-url` | Needs existing AWS connection            |
| `datastream-token check-status`              | Polls for live ingest data               |
| `metric view`, `alert view`                  | No metrics/alerts on CI tenant inventory |

## Resource ownership

Mutating tests must follow the create → assert → delete lifecycle:

1. Generate a unique prefix with `testPrefix()` (e.g. `cli-a1b2c3d4`).
2. Create resources using that prefix in the name (via CLI under test, or via `setup.ts` when seeding fixtures).
3. **Register teardown immediately** after creation succeeds — before assertions — so resources are cleaned up even when a test fails mid-way. For resources created via CLI: `fixture.registerCleanup(() => deleteIngestToken(tenant, created.id))`. Setup helpers in `setup.ts` register their own cleanup.
4. Assert only on resources this test created (by name or ID in list/view output).

**Do not:**

- Assert list sizes or global tenant state (`expect(items.length).toBe(5)`).
- Assert that pre-existing resources have specific values.
- Delete or modify resources you did not create.

Other tests are expected not to touch resources they did not create.

## Naming

Use `testPrefix()` for every resource name:

```typescript
const prefix = testPrefix();
const name = `${prefix}-ingest-token`;
```

Prefix pattern: `cli-<8 hex chars>`. A future sweeper can match `^cli-` to clean up orphans.

## Assertions

`parseJsonOutput` throws when the CLI exits non-zero, so a successful parse means the command succeeded.

```typescript
// Good — register cleanup right after create, before assertions
const prefix = testPrefix();
const result =
  await fixture.runCli`observe ingest-token create --name ${prefix}-token`;
const created = parseJsonOutput(result) as Token;
fixture.registerCleanup(() => deleteIngestToken(tenant, created.id));
expect(created.name).toBe(`${prefix}-token`);

// Good — validate response shape; datasets are guaranteed on any functional tenant
expect(Array.isArray(datasets)).toBe(true);
expect(datasets.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);

// Good — empty list is valid for resource types not present in every tenant
expect(Array.isArray(metrics)).toBe(true);

// Bad — depends on tenant inventory
expect(monitors.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
expect(monitors[0].label).toBe("Production alert");
```

## Fixture lifecycle

Use `withIntegrationFixture` so each test gets an isolated temp `$HOME/.observe/config.json`. This is required for parallel execution — do not share a module-level fixture variable across concurrent tests.

Pass commands to `fixture.runCli` as a tagged template literal. Write shell commands the way you would in a terminal, including `\` line continuations for multiline (Bun Shell reads the template's raw segments). Every command must start with `observe`; the fixture strips that prefix and runs `bun src/bin.ts …` via [Bun Shell](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/shell). A missing or malformed command throws `InvalidCliCommandError` (a test authoring mistake, not a CLI failure).

```typescript
test("example", async () => {
  await withIntegrationFixture(tenant, async (fixture) => {
    const result = await fixture.runCli`
      observe dataset list \
        --format json \
        --limit 5
    `;
    // ...
  });
});
```

Single-line commands can go on one row inside the template:

```typescript
await fixture.runCli`
  observe auth status --json
`;
```

For dynamic arguments, interpolate into the template (quote values that may contain spaces):

```typescript
await fixture.runCli`
  observe query \
    --input ${datasetId} \
    --pipeline "limit 1" \
    --format json \
    --interval 24h
`;
```

## Parallelism

Tests are designed to run in parallel against a shared tenant. Unique prefixes and the ownership rules above make that safe. `bun run test:integration` runs with `--concurrent --max-concurrency 5`. Use `test.serial` only when a test genuinely cannot run alongside others (rare).

## Timeouts

`test:integration` defaults to **10s** per test. Slow tests override with `INTEGRATION_TIMEOUT` from `fixture.ts`:

| Tier              | Timeout | Use for                             |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| default           | 10s     | CRUD, read-only, smoke              |
| `graphRebuild`    | 30s     | Dataset/datastream/monitor creation |
| `materialization` | 90s     | Poll until queryable/ingested       |

Set `retryUntil` poll budgets via `MATERIALIZATION_POLL_TIMEOUT_MS` (80s); keep them below the test timeout.

```typescript
test(
  "…",
  async () => {
    /* … */
  },
  { timeout: INTEGRATION_TIMEOUT.graphRebuild },
);
```

## Cleanup and setup helpers

**Cleanup** (`integration/cleanup.ts`) — every resource created during a test must be cleaned up. Register teardown with `fixture.registerCleanup()` immediately after creation, before assertions. Cleanups run in LIFO order when the fixture is torn down; failures are logged but do not fail the test.

**Setup** (`integration/setup.ts`) — when a test needs resources in the environment that aren't part of what it's testing, use setup helpers to create them via API instead of CLI. This includes resources the CLI can't create yet, but also resources the CLI _can_ create when the test simply doesn't care about exercising that path. Setup helpers register their own cleanup automatically.
